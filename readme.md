### Blog App with Angular 2 + Redux pattern

Angular 2 starter with TypeScript RxJS Gulp4 Express(Server) and MongoDB

The Blog App is developed using the Redux Pattern Where the project it's not using any Redux library,

it's using RxJS Observables simulating the 3 principal characteristics:

- Single Source of Truth

- State of the App is immutable

- Changing the state its only with Pure Functions

Elements to consider for understanding the code are: Dependency Injection, RxJS Observable, and Redux Pattern, ES6 etc...

To Run the blog App it's recommended to open the browser and shrink it to the minimum simulating an mobile screen, cause it is mobile first design pattern and its css is not completed for bigger screen's
